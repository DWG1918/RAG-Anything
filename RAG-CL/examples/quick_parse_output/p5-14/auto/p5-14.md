# General Topics

# 1.1 Introduction

Siemens product development has developed a standardised package solution. The aims of this project are o:

• Create a product that is structured to fit varied markets through the use of pre engineered options Reduce package purchase cost Reduce the manufacturing time and costs   
• Reduce installation and maintenance time and cost   
• Reduce product structure to a level where it is maintainable   
• Create a set of standard documentation.

This specification gives the technical requirements concerning procurement of the acoustic package. The package has two configurations:

Based around the requirements for an onshore application • For offshore applications.

This specification covers the technical aspects of the package. For a complete set of options, supplier drawing numbers and any supplier specific detail please refer to the supplier specific specification.

The bidder shall conform to this technical specification and its attachments and, in detail, state any points of divergence.

If any component or unit that is not mentioned in this specification can be considered to form an essential part of the equipment of delivery, it must still be included in the scope of supply. The delivery shall include all necessary equipment to form a complete and functional unit.

The Package covered by these requirements is defined by its function rather than design type. Thus the specification is stated in performance terms rather than being specified by detailed description of the Acoustic Package to be supplied.

# 1.2 Description of the Main Scope of Supply

The acoustic package scope consists of

a) Acoustic enclosure and support steelwork where necessary.   
b) Ventilation system including fan(s), silencer, ventilation dampers, filter where required and duct work.   
c) Combustion intake system including filtration, silencer and ductwork d) Exhaust system including silencer, duct work and expansion joint where required.   
e) L.O cooler pipework, breather pipework and P2 pipe work external to enclosure.   
f) Cable tray and small bore pipework above the enclosure roof.

\*Or Siemens works when combined test is required

This specification should be read in conjunction with SGT-100-2S N package acoustic equipment parameter drawing RU01042A.

# References and Design Codes

a) The design shall comply with all applicable International and European Standards. The supplier shall define what standards are applicable.

b) The supplier shall use their expertise to ensure that the developed standards cater for local legislation where possible. In instances where the standards are not suitable for local legislation, the supplier must consider pre-definition of how standards will be adapted to suit, and the implications thereof.

d) All technical data, calculations and measurements shall be presented in SI-units.

# 3.7 Fluids specification

See fluids specification 65/0027. This gives details of combustion and instrument air quality requirements.

# 3.8 Heat release

Note: The figures given in this table have been increased from 73kW following measurements during a combined test validation. The above increased heat release values are formally specified for all projects from NU0415/01-02 onwards (previous projects managed on a contract-specific basis).

# 3.9 Enclosure pressures

a) Nominal positive pressure in enclosure due to fan operating: +30mmH2O (±5mmH2O)   
b) Max design over pressure in enclosure: +100mmH2O   
c) Max design under pressure in enclosure: -100mmH2O

# 3.10 Zone in and around package

a) Inside the enclosure is considered a zone 2 area while the fans are running. If ventilation fails and gas is still present on skid the enclosure becomes a zone 1 area.   
b) Positive pressure set: 0.760m loci from enclosure wall zone 2 while fans running   
c) Negative pressure set: Safe area outside enclosure while fans running   
d) See TDR 04/247 for more information

# 3.12 Noise data

The figures quoted as sound power levels (SWL) Ref. 10-12 Watt, dB are calculated from in-duct sound pressure level measurements .

The inlet noise figures, are measured in the middle of the inlet duct approximately 1m above the inlet cas ing, using a condenser microphone fitted with an aerodynamic nose cone.

The exhaust noise figures, are measured in the middle of a vertically orientated radial exhaust duct approximately 1m above the collector, using a calibrated hot gas sound level probe system.

The turbine casing noise levels are quoted as sound pressure levels (SPL) Ref. 2 x 10-5 N/m2, dB. These were measured at 1m from the turbine skid edge of an unenclosed set and at a height level with the core engine centre line, using a condenser microphone and wind shield.

All noise data is subject to a tolerance of ±2dB.
